# Switch Statements

![Adventure Time](http://i.giphy.com/FVbsOFYqdARtS.gif)


## Learning Objectives - The student should be able to..

* Explain that a switch statement considers a value and compares it against several possible matching patterns. It will execute an appropriate block of code, based on the **first** pattern that matches successfully. 
* Explain that a switch statement provides an alternative to the if statement which they had just learned to use.
* Understands that each case is a separate branch of code execution.
* Understands that every switch statement **must** be exhaustive. This means that every possible value of the type being considered must be matched by one of the switch cases.
* Explain that it's not practical to write **all** posible cases, where they could provide a default case to match all other possibilities as a catch-all. 






## Outline / Notes

At this point you should feel comfortable with boolean expressions and ````if/else```` conditional clauses.  If you have any confusion about those topics please stop and review them before continuing beause this lesson is about a *more advanced* version of ````if/else````.

You may have noticed that when you're chaining multiple ````if/else```` conditions together your code can start to feel a little... *hairy*; that's because while it's *possible* to chain as may ````if/else```` conditions together as you want the construct wasn't really designed for that.

The ````Switch```` statement has one purpose which it is exceedingly good at: helping you write clear and correct code when you need to take more than two courses of action based upon the value of a constant, variable, or the returned value of a function.

In the previous lesson we had the following chained ````if/else````:

````Swift
if sallyDressColor == "yellow" {
	wearSomethingGreen()
} else if sallyDressColor == "blue" {
	wearSomethingPurple()
} else if sallyDressColor == "red" {
	wearSomethingOrangle() 
} else if sallyDressColor == "green" {
	wearSomethingBlue()
} else ...
// that's a lot of decision-making!
````

There are two problems with code like this.  The first problem is that the repetitions of ````if sallyDressColor ==```` create a trance-like state when you're reading the code and obfuscate what you're *really* trying to understand or communicate, which is *what* color the dress is.  The ````Switch```` statement solves this problem by eliminating that code altogether and letting you just focus on what matters; it does this by taking a single value (which is what you're "switching" over) and then taking a series of possible values and related actions.

Let's see how the above Conditional chain would look if re-written as a Switch:

````Swift
switch sallyDressColor  {
	case "yellow":
		wearSomethingGreen()
		
	case "blue":
		wearSomethingPurple()
			
	case "red":
		wearSomethingOrange()
			
	case "green":
		wearSomethingBlue()
		
	default:
		wearSomethingBlack()
}
````

Take a moment to compare and contrast the ````if/else```` chain with the ````switch````; you should start seeing how the ````switch```` statment is much cleaner and clearer.

You should also see *another* imporant difference, namely the presence of ````default```` in the ````switch````.  This solves the second problem with the chained ````if/else````, namely forgetting to handle one or more conditions that need to be handled.

Using the ````if/else```` example above, we woudn't know what to wear if Sally was wearing a color other than yellow, blue, red or green (and let's face it: if you know Sally at all then you know she's liable to wear *any* color!).  In fact, depending on how the rest of our code was written we'd either wind up wearing a bad color or even not getting dressed at all!

The Swift compiler very helpfully makes sure that every possible value of whatever we're "switching" over is handled.  So, we could use a ````switch```` for a boolean value:

````Swift
switch 5 <= 3 {
	case true:
		print("true")
	case false:
		print("false")
	}
````

which is equivalent to:

````Swift
switch 5 <= 3 {
	case true:
		print("true")
		
	default:
		print("it ain't true")
}
````

and if we only wrote:

````Swift
switch 5 <3 {
	case true:
		print("true")
}
````
then the compiler would helpfully tell us that we weren't handling all possible values.

The final trick we'll cover is using ````ranges```` with ````switch````.  For example, if you want to check if a value is between 1 and 5 or 6 and 10, you *could* write:

````Swift
let x = 9

if x >= 1 && x <= 5 {
    print("x is in the range of 1-5")
} else if x >= 6 && x <= 10 {
    print("x is in the range of 6-10")
}

// prints "x is in the range of 6-10"
````

Or, you could use write it like this:

````Swift
let x = 9

switch x {
case 1...5:
    print("Range is 1-5")
case 6...10:
    print("Range is 6-10")
default:
    print("x is greater than 10")
}

// prints "Range is 6-10"
````

Which do YOU think is easier to read, write and debug?
	
But wait, there's still more!

The ````switch```` statement actually has many more features which are useful as your programs grow more complex.  While we won't cover them here (because you haven't yet had a chance to fully digest what we've just covered and also don't yet have enough context to fully appreciate the use-cases), you can look forward to learning about how the ````switch```` statement can also handle pattern matching and value binding, and especially how it really comes into its own in making stable, clear software when used in conjunction with ````Enums````.
